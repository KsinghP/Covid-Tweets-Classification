# How to Use

This project is my attempt to enable users to understand and navigate the problem of Covid-related misinformation on Twitter. It works by accepting user inputs on a web app (http://). There are two inputs that users can give:
1. Covid-related keyword(s) and number of tweets: users can input one or more keywords (list provided on the “How to use” page of the app) and a certain number of tweets. The app will work on the backend to pull the same number of latest tweets based on the provided keywords, and inform users of the percentage breakup of conspiratorial and non-conspiratorial tweets. 
2. Twitter handle: users can input a handle to check whether its Covid-related tweets are conspiratorial or non-conspiratorial. On the backend, the app achieves this by pulling in 3200 of the given handle’s latest tweets related to Covid - tweets are filtered by keywords to select Covid-related ones, and the number might be less than 3200 depending on how many such tweets can be found – and analysing them to see how many of those are conspiratorial. If the proportion is > 25%, the handle is reported as tweeting conspiratorially about Covid. Users can also see a wordcloud of the given handle’s covid-related tweets.
